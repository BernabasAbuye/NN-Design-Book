Problem Statement

A produce dealer has a warehouse that stores a variety of fruits and vege-
tables. When fruit is brought to the warehouse, various types of fruit may
be mixed together. The dealer wants a machine that will sort the fruit ac-
cording to type. There is a conveyer belt on which the fruit is loaded. This
conveyer passes through a set of sensors, which measure three properties
of the fruit: shape, texture and weight. These sensors are somewhat primi-
tive. The shape sensor will output a 1 if the fruit is approximately round
and a if it is more elliptical. The texture sensor will output a 1 if the sur-
face of the fruit is smooth and a if it is rough. The weight sensor will
output a 1 if the fruit is more than one pound and a if it is less than one
pound.

The three sensor outputs will then be input to a neural network. The pur-
pose of the network is to decide which kind of fruit is on the conveyor, so
that the fruit can be directed to the correct storage bin. To make the prob-
lem even simpler, let’s assume that there are only two kinds of fruit on the
conveyor: apples and oranges.

As each fruit passes through the sensors it can be represented by a three-
dimensional vector. The first element of the vector will represent shape,
the second element will represent texture and the third element will repre-
sent weight:

p = [shape, texture, weight]

Therefore, a prototype orange would be represented by  p1 = [1 -1 -1]

and a prototype apple would be represented by p2 = [1 1 -1]

The neural network will receive one three-dimensional input vector for
each fruit on the conveyer and must make a decision as to whether the fruit
is an orange or an apple .
Now that we have defined this simple (trivial?) pattern recognition prob-
lem, let’s look briefly at three different neural networks that could be used
to solve it. The simplicity of our problem will facilitate our understanding
of the operation of the networks.
